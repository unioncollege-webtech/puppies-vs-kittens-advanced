### Get a REDIS server running before running the server

Create an Express application to judge who is cuter: puppies or kittens.

Description
-----------

In this exercise we will build a website that will allow visitors to vote on
which is cuter: puppies or kittens. The website will consist of one static
index.html file and two dynamic routes: one to record votes for puppies, the
other to record votes for kittens. Additionally, we will define a new [class][classes]
called `Counter` and use it to record the votes.

### Create an Express application

Since the website will have a mix of [static] and [dynamic] content, we will use
Express to build our application.

Currently [server.js](./server.js) has an outline of the steps necessary to
serve static files and respond to the `get` requests to `/kittens` and
`/puppies`. Use the [Express API documentation][Express] (specifically, the pages
linked to in the [References](#references) section below) to build out the
required pieces. Feel free to use the [Express Static Server] repository as a
starting point as well.

## Create the `Counter` function

In this exercise we are also experimenting with
[creating classes in JavaScript][classes]. JavaScript doesn't have traditional
classes like a typical object oriented programming language. Instead, JavaScript
uses functions as constructors for classes, and we use the `new` operator to
construct objects from those functions. Instance methods are created by
adding functions to the `.prototype` property of the constructor function.

> Reference note: the Mozilla Developer Network’s
[Introduction to Object-Oriented JavaScript][classes] is an excellent
description of JavaScript’s approach to object-oriented programming.

We will be defining a new class called `Counter` to record the votes for puppies
and kittens. We'll create a new counter instance, then call `counter.record('puppies')`
to record a vote for puppies, and `counter.record('kittens')` to record votes for
kittens. We'll retrive the accumulated votes by calling
`counter.retrieve('puppies')`, and `counter.retrieve('kittens')`.

A starting point for the `Counter` class is below:

```js
// Counter constructor definition
function Counter() {
    // Create a property on the `this` reference to store counts for each key
}

// .record(key) - increment the count value for `key`
Counter.prototype.record = function(key) {

};

// .retrieve(key) - retrieve the total recorded counts for `key`
Counter.prototype.retrieve = function(key) {

};

// .results() - return an object containing the cumulative counts for all keys
Counter.prototype.results = function() {

};

// Create a new counter instance
var voteCounter = new Counter();

// Record a vote for kittens
voteCounter.record('kittens');
// Retrieve the number of votes for kittens
var kittenVotes = voteCounter.retrieve('kittens');
// => 1
```

Once we create the `Counter` class, we will
[use it inside our route handlers](https://github.com/unioncollege-webtech/puppies-vs-kittens/blob/master/server.js#L18)
for '/puppies' and '/kittens' to record the votes and retrieve the totals.


## Add links to “index.html”

Visitors to the website will be served [`index.html`](./index.html) and will
cast their votes by clicking on a link for their preferred animal. We need to
update index.html and add links to "/puppies" and "/kittens" so it looks
something like this:

> <h1>Puppies vs. Kittens</h1>
> <p>Cast your vote for the cuter creature: puppies or kittens:</p>
>
> <a href="/puppies">Puppies</a> <a href="/kittens">Kittens</a>

When the user clicks on one of those links, they will be sent to `/puppies` or
`/kittens` on our domain. We will be listening for those requests in `server.js`
and will send back a message like the following:

> Thank you for voting! Kittens have 12 total votes so far.

## Style the pages

Currently there are no styles for our Puppies Versus Kittens voting website.
Create a `style.css` file with some lovely styles for this application. Feel
free to update `index.html` as necessary.
